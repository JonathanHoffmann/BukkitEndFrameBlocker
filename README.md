# BukkitEndFrameBlocker

Prevents players from interacting with End Frame Blocks, mainly for adding Eyes of Ender.
This would not prevent players from using portals that spawn with all Eyes of Ender.
The plugin was a quick and dirty way for my own server to wait for a dependency to be updated, if you want something like this, I rekommend changing this plugin or looking somewhere else.
